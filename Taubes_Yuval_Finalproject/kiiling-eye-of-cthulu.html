                <p>
                    Terraria is a 2d side scroller game where you explore the world, mine, and kill bosses.
                    Terraria is a game that does not hold your hand and throws you into the deep end. This guide
                    will take you through the proper preparations to kill your first boss, The Eye of Cthulhu.
                </p>

                    Basic Tools
                </h4>
                <p>
                    After Downloading the game, create a new character and world. Once you have spawned in,
                    start deforesting the area with your axe. We need the wood to craft the following Items

                <ul>

                    <li>Wood Helmet</li>

                    <li>Wood Breastplate</li>

                    <li>Wood greaves</li>

                <h4>
                    Finding A Cave
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Once complete, start exploring to the left or right of the spawn area until you come upon an
                    entrance into the ground. Inside the cave you will find some chests and pots, loot them and
                    explore deeper.
                <div class="img-container">
                    <img src="assets/img/terraria/cave.png">

                <h4>
                    Looting The Cave
                </h4>
                <p>
                    As you explore deeper into the cave you should come across a railway system that extends to
                    the left and right. Hover your mouse over the railroad and right-click, this will place you
                    into a minecart. Pull out a torch and slowly explore to the left and right of the minecart
                    track, you will usually find an Underground Cabin. Underground Cabins usually contain a gold
                    chest, with some great early game loot. On your way to the Underground Cabin you may find
                    some heart crystals, make sure to grab those.
                <div class="img-container">
                    <div class="flexbox">
                        <img src="assets/img/terraria/underground-cabin.png">
                        <img src="assets/img/terraria/heart-crystal.png">
                    </div>
                    <p>An Underground cabin, and a couple of life crystals.</p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    While exploring the cave our goals are to:
                <ol>

                    <li>Get more heart crystals</li>

                    <li>Find 28 pieces of Gold/Platinum</li>

                    <li>Find armour/accessories in chests</li>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                For the boss fight, a minimum of 10 hearts is required, because of the large damage output the Eye has
                in its second phase. We need the Gold/Platinum for our weapon. The armour and accessories will increase
                attack speed, defence, and movement speed.

                <h4>Weapons</h4>
                <p>
                    The weapon you are using is going to make a big difference in the amount of damage we deal.
                    Using the gold/Platinum bow is a great way to make killing the boss easy. To make this bow
                    we need to find a total of 28 pieces of gold ore or platinum ore. To make this bow, follow
                    this list of instructions:

                <ol>

                    <li>Find the 28 pieces of gold/platinum</li>

                    <li>Smelt the ore into bars (by using a furnace)</li>

                    <li>Craft it into a bow using an anvil</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>
                    Ammo
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Just as important as the bow, is the ammo. Frostburn arrows are the best choice for killing
                    the Eye of Cthulhu. To make these arrows you are going to need:

                <ul>

                    <li>wood</li>

                    <li>stone</li>

                    <li>gel</li>

                    <li>Ice block</li>

                </ul>

                    Use the stone and wood to make arrows, and use wood, gel, and ice blocks to make ice
                    torches. Combining those will give you Frostburn Arrows

                <h4>
                    Armour
                </h4>

                <p>
                    Armour is also an important part of the boss fight, however in this case just use what you
                    can find. Aim for a total of 8 defences (counting accessories). The accessories for this
                    fight don’t matter too much, just use the items with the best modifiers.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Potions
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The only potions you need for this fight are the Healing potions, However Ironskin potions
                    are highly recommended, for the extra defence. Thorns potions are also optional to help with
                    the second phase of the fight.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    The Stadium
                </h4>
                <p>
                    A crucial part of this fight is the stadium, due to the speed the boss has in its second
                    phase. It is best to have a long platform spanning the entire forest biome. By making it
                    long it allows you to stay ahead of the eye, making it easy to hit your shots.

                </p>
                <h4>Spawning the Boss</h4>
                <p>
                    To spawn the boss collect 9 lenses from demon eyes. Demon eyes only spawn during the night
                    so just dedicate some time to farming them. To craft the Suspicious looking eye (the
                    spawning item) go to a demon altar and then craft it within your inventory.
                    <div class="img-container">

                </p>
                <h4>
                    Fighting the Boss
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The boss has 2 phases. During the first phase, the eye will send smaller demon eyes to come
                    and attack you (They drop hearts when killed). Switch to a sword when the demon eyes get
                    close, so you don’t get overwhelmed. In the second phase, the eye sheds its skin and reveals
                    a mouth (It Enters its second phase at half health). In this interval the eye stays still,
                    take advantage and do as much damage as possible. In the second phase the movement pattern
                    changes, its speed also dramatically increases. This is where the long stadium comes into
                    play, you should be able to run and dodge its quick attacks.

                    Following this guide will make killing the Eye of Cthulhu a breeze, and officially starting
                    your terraria journey. Depending on your world type your next boss is either the Brain of
                    Cthulhu or the Eater of worlds. Both are exponentially more difficult than the boss you just
                    fought, Good Luck Terrarian.
